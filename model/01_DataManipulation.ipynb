    "This notebook is dedicated to the initial stages of the EuroSAT image classification project, focusing on data extraction and organization. The primary tasks accomplished in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Extraction: The notebook starts with extracting the EuroSAT dataset, which is composed of satellite images labeled with various types of land cover. The extraction process involves downloading the dataset from its source repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organization of Data: Following extraction, the dataset is meticulously organized into separate folders for training and testing purposes. This organization is crucial for model training and evaluation, ensuring that data is easily accessible and systematically arranged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mapping Folder Names to IDs: Each folder, representing a distinct type of land cover, is mapped to a unique identifier (ID). This mapping facilitates the classification task by associating each land cover type with a specific ID, simplifying the training and prediction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database Description and Download Link: The notebook also includes a comprehensive description of the EuroSAT dataset, highlighting its significance and utility in satellite image classification tasks. Additionally, information on where to download the dataset is provided, ensuring that the project is reproducible and accessible to others"

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The EuroSAT dataset is a comprehensive land cover classification dataset that focuses on images taken by the ESA Sentinel-2 satellite. It contains a total of 27,000 images, each with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. These images cover 10 distinct land cover classes and are collected from over 34 European countries. The dataset is available in two versions: RGB only (this repo) and all 13 Multispectral (MS) Sentinel-2 bands. EuroSAT is considered a relatively easy dataset, with approximately 98.6% accuracy achievable using a ResNet-50 architecture.*\"\n",
